# IIT-Pallakad-ML-Prediction-competition-

My solutions to IIT Pallakad ML Prediction Competition 

The questions are availaible in the PDF file in this repository .

There were 3 questions , based on - Classification , Regression and Forecasting .

I have explained my appoach towards these questions in the comments in the code itself . 

I have made a specific folder for each of the questions . Each question folder contains the data required ( training , validation and testing datasets respectively as per the Q ) . And also contains the code file showing my work for that questions as well as the final predictions . The question can be read from the pdf.
