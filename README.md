My solutions to IIT Pallakad ML Prediction Competition 

UPDATE - This entry secured 13th position overall in the competition , thus being awesome for a 2 month experienced ml person like me :) . The individual questions ranks were also provided - 20th rank in Classification Problem , 17th rank in Regression Problem , and 2nd rank in Forecasting Problem . The experience has been great and looking forward to compete in more events like this :)    .

The questions are availaible in the PDF file in this repository .

There were 3 questions , based on - Classification , Regression and Forecasting .

I have explained my appoach towards these questions in the comments in the code itself . 

I have made a specific folder for each of the questions . Each question folder contains the data required ( training , validation and testing datasets respectively as per the Q ) . And also contains the code file showing my work for that questions as well as the final predictions . The question can be read from the pdf.
